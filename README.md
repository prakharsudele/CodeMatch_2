🧠 CodeMatch — Tinder for Developers

Have you used Tinder?
Now imagine one built only for engineering majors & developers.
CodeMatch 💻❤️ is a skill-based matching platform where developers don’t match on looks —
they match on GitHub stats, LeetCode progress, and shared goals.
Swipe, match, and collaborate with like-minded developers — just like Tinder, but for engineers.

🧠 What I Learned

Building CodeMatch taught me how real products are designed, broken, and rebuilt.
Handling OAuth & token security
Designing scalable APIs
Debugging production-only bugs
Managing async data & race conditions
Writing clean, maintainable frontend logic
Thinking like a product engineer, not just a coder
A week of stress, anxiety, debugging, and dopamine — completely worth it.


🛡️ Security Notes

OAuth tokens are securely handled
No sensitive data is committed to the repository
